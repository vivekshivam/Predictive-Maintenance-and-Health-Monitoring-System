The Predictive Maintenance and Health Monitoring System (PMHMS) is a strategic initiative aimed at revolutionizing industrial equipment maintenance through advanced analytics and machine learning. By leveraging historical maintenance data, PMHMS predicts maintenance schedules and assesses equipment health to preemptively address potential failures, thereby minimizing downtime, enhancing operational safety, and reducing maintenance costs. Key features include predictive modeling for determining next maintenance dates, calculating health scores based on historical data analysis, and providing interactive dashboards for real-time equipment monitoring. 

Technologies such as Excel for initial data management, Python for robust data processing and machine learning model development, and PowerBI for intuitive data visualization and dashboard creation are utilized to support PMHMS. Future enhancements are envisioned in areas like advanced machine learning techniques, IoT integration for continuous monitoring, scalable data management solutions, and improved user interface functionalities.

Contributions to the project are encouraged, ensuring adherence to established coding standards and comprehensive documentation to foster continuous improvement and innovation in predictive maintenance strategies. Note: The dataset used for this project is confidential due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and cannot be shared.

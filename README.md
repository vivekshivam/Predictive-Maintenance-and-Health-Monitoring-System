Welcome to the Predictive Maintenance and Health Monitoring System (PMHMS) repository. This project aims to optimize industrial equipment maintenance through predictive analytics and health monitoring, leveraging machine learning techniques to predict maintenance schedules and assess equipment health.

The Predictive Maintenance and Health Monitoring System (PMHMS) is designed to help industries reduce downtime, improve safety, and lower maintenance costs by predicting equipment failures before they occur. The system uses machine learning models to analyze historical maintenance data and forecast future maintenance needs.

Features
Predicts next maintenance dates for equipment
Calculates health scores for equipment based on maintenance data
Provides interactive dashboards for monitoring equipment health
Integrates with web-based platforms for real-time data processing and remote monitoring
Technologies Used
Excel: Data management and initial analysis
Python: Data processing, machine learning, and system development
VSCode: Code development and editing
GeeksforGeeks (GFG): Learning resources and tutorials
Machine Learning (ML): Algorithms and models for predictive maintenance
PowerBI: Data visualization and dashboard creation

Install PowerBI Desktop for creating and viewing dashboards.

Usage
Prepare your data in an Excel file named classified_data.xlsx and place it in the root directory. Note: The dataset used for this project is confidential due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and cannot be shared.

Open PowerBI Desktop and load the equipment_health_scores.xlsx file to visualize the data.

Future Scope
The PMHMS can be further optimized and refined through:

Web Integration: Integrating with web-based platforms for real-time data processing and remote monitoring.
Advanced Machine Learning: Implementing sophisticated ML and deep learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
IoT Integration: Incorporating IoT devices for continuous monitoring and immediate anomaly detection.
Data Management: Transitioning to scalable and secure database solutions.
Enhanced User Interface: Improving dashboard functionalities with modern web technologies.
